# Resturant-Managment-System
A Restaurant Management System in Assembly Language efficiently manages restaurant operations, including order processing, billing, and inventory control. It features quick customer order processing, real-time inventory updates, and accurate billing with taxes and service charges. 
INTRODUCTION
Restaurant Billing System is a computer based billing system with user friendly interface which automatically manages the billing process of the customer very easily taking only a short period of time. The system can large amount of data and also generates bill for the customer. Billing history, reservation information and staff information can also be obtained with the use of RBS. It is an automated desktop based software which has a simple design and very easy to use also. This project’s main focus is on proper management of information regarding the staffs, billing and reservation records. It is also specialized in automatically processing the customer bills and discounts.
The proposed system either does not require paper work or very few paper works are required. All the data is fetched into the computer immediately and various bills can be generated through computers. Since all the data is kept in a database, no data of the organization can be destroyed. Moreover, works become very easy because there is no need to keep data on papers.
OBJECTIVE:
The motive and objective to digitalize the restaurant menu and billing system is to save time, resources, reduce human error to minimum and making the menu system more environmentally friendly

METHODOLOGY:
1.	For entering the data of one user, a function is used. Its purpose is to show menu and ask for order. After selecting menu item, it will ask for quantity and then after pressing ok it will show the total cost.
2.	After showing the cost it will show another option which is re-order. For re-order we have to press 1 or press any key to exit.
3.	There are total 3 items. If the user enters 4 then the system will say if you want to add this item press 1 and press 2 to get back to menu. After pressing 1 it will ask for food name and price and then it will return to the menu and also show the added item.  

TOOL /SOFTWARE:

Another advantage of 8086 instruction set is that it is much smaller, and thus easier to learn. Emu8086 has a much easier syntax than any of the major assemblers, but will still generate a program that can be executed on any computer that runs 8086 machine code; a great combination for beginners!

FEASIBILITY:
The feasibility study is carried out to test whether the proposed system is worth being implemented. Feasibility study is a test of system proposed regarding its work ability, its impact on the organization to meet user needs and effective use of resources. It is usually carried out by a small number of people who are familiar with the information system techniques, understand the part of the business or organization that will be involved or affected by the project and are skilled in the system analysis and design process.
The key consideration involved in the feasibility study are:
•	Technical feasibility
•	Economic feasibility
•	Operational feasibility
•	Schedule feasibility

CONCLUSION:
The documentation includes all necessary information on the structure and the coding of the program created for Restaurant Billing system. Creating the program was an overwhelming task that required a lot of analyzing, research work and personal skills. Creating this report has been a great experience and numerous facts have been learned since the required tasks were very challenging. Tasks such as creating a system to a restaurant, needed research work as well as personal skills. Creating proper design and smooth flow of operation was a very tiring task that consumed a lot of time
Applications
1.	Improved accuracy.
2.	It saves you time.
3.	It allows customer to track menu items easily.
